# This file consists of our frontend where we played around with our smart contract and the web3 libraries. To do so you can clone the repository and from your command line run the following commands:
    • truffle migrate --reset 
    • npm run dev
    
This will open the UI in your browser after which you can play around with registering a gun using your ethereum accounts on ganache!
